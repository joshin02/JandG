## Purpose
Redesign concept website for local hair salon. 
## Reason
I wanted to help out a local business that I've been going to for quite some time now. When talking with the owener, she was having trouble with website 
maintenence in Weebly. I decided to recreate her business website for her from scratch and base it on a new and more modern design concept. I also wanted to
make the website maintenece on her end much simpler so she can focus on her clients.
## Technologies Used
I utilized HTML5, CSS3, and javsascript for the orginal website development and design and integrated a headleass CMS (Decap) for the client to use to update the site as needed.
